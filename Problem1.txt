Q.1
-----------------

Write a distributed application for registering and logging in on a server using RPC
mechanism. Below are the services provided by the remote procedures that you would write:

	1. Register on the server using a "username" and a "password".
	2. Log in to the server using a "username" and "password".

The usernames and passwords should be stored in a database. The database can be a file
which the server can read from and write to. It is up to you to decide how the database should
be. This database should contain a username "admin" by default and a password of your choice.
When the server gets request for registration:
	
	a. If the username is already in the database, send a message to the client saying
	   "Username already exists. Try a different one" (without quotes).
	
	b. If the username is not in the database, send a message to the client saying "Registration
	   successful" and create a corresponding entry in the database.

After the registration is successful, then the client program should ask the user if he/she wants
to login. If yes, then follow the flow mentioned below.
When the server gets request for a login:

	a. If the username and password match, send a message to the client saying "Welcome
	   <username>!" (without quotes) where <username> is the username entered by the user.

	b. If the username and password match for the user "admin", send a message to the client
	   saying "Welcome admin! Number of registered users are <number_of_users>", where
	   <number_of_users> are the number of users in the database.

The program should exit as soon as the flow for login is complete. Write code for printing
corresponding messages received by the server appropriately. Also, attach screenshots
showing the ports on which the rpc server and client are bound to.
